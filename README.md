I am Karthikeyan Pondicherry Rammohan have a quite an experience with computers. In childhood used computers mostly for gaming purposes. At a particular time i got introduced to C++ programming and had a hard time learning it as the time passed and the basics became strong I fell in love with programming and got involved and learnt alot of things. I worked on few projects such as finding shortest escape route during hazard. During the bachelors time i worked on projects such as Speech Synthesis, ATM with OTP,QR code payment, File sharing with hybrid key based system. I have had a great experience with computers. I have always zeal to learn new things in computers.



I have worked on a webpage before but it was a basic webpage. I always wanted to learn programming languages that are used to build websites and backend coding part. This course would help me alot to build up my knowledge and get handson  experience about the technology.
